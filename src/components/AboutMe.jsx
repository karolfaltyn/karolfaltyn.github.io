                <p>
                  My adventure with frontend began in the second year of IT
                  technical secondary school. Before I knew it, programming
                  became my passion. I immediately started writing small
                  projects to practice and expand knowledge. My school organized
                  two months internship in a company, where I strengthened my
                  teamwork skills and continued to improve my programming
                  experience and other knowledge related to computer networks
                  and databases. I also earned several Cisco certifications,
                  thanks to my school's collaboration with the Cisco Networking
                  Academy. At the end of secondary school I became an IT
                  specialist, passing the INF 02, INF 03 IT exams and the
                  secondary school leaving exam.
